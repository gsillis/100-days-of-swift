// Summary
// You can create your own types using structures, which can have their own properties and methods.
// You can use stored properties or use computed properties to calculate values on the fly.
// If you want to change a property inside a method, you must mark it as mutating.
// Initializers are special methods that create structs. You get a memberwise initializer by default, but if you create your own you must give all properties a value.
// Use the self constant to refer to the current instance of a struct inside a method.
// The lazy keyword tells Swift to create properties only when they are first used.
// You can share properties and methods across all instances of a struct using the static keyword.
// Access control lets you restrict what code can use properties and methods.
